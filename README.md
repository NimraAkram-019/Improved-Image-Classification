# Classification Using EfficientNet
EfficientNet is a family of CNN's built by Google and it is currently the most performant convolutional neural network for classification. These CNNs not only provide better accuracy but also improve the efficiency of the models by reducing the number of parameters as compared to the other state-of-the-art models. By using this model 97% accuracy is acheived.

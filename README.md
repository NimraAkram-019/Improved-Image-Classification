# Improved Image Classification

# Dataset
The dataset is taken from "https://www.kaggle.com/c/deeplearningclassificationtask/data"
The dataset consists of several images divided into following 10 classes: 
1. Airplane
2. Bird
3. Car
4. Cat
5. Deer
6. Dog
7. Horse
8. Monkey
9. Ship
10. Truck

12. We need to design a model to predict the label of these images correctly. Hence, EfficientNet is used for this purpose. 

# Classification Using EfficientNet
EfficientNet is a family of CNN's built by Google and it is currently the most performant convolutional neural network for classification. These CNNs not only provide better accuracy but also improve the efficiency of the models by reducing the number of parameters as compared to the other state-of-the-art models. By using this model 97% accuracy is acheived.

# Note: 
You can run this project on Jupyter Notebook or on Google Colaboratory. While training the dataset on Google Colab, change runtime and select GPU for faster computation.
